# top_API_restapi-tutorial

This is the exercise from [API Basics | The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-api-basics).

This code was created by following along this guide: [How to create a REST API with Express.js in Node.js](https://www.robinwieruch.de/node-express-server-rest-api/).

The code in the tutorial uses ES6 module syntax. This is not natively supported in Node.js unless it is enabled explicitly. Previous tutorials from MDN and TOP have been using the CommonJS module syntax.

To enable ES6 moduels in Node.js, you can rename your fiel extension from `.js` to `.mjs`. or add `"type": "module"` to package.json file.
